Greg has a tree of nodes containing integer data. He wants to insert a node with some non-zero integer value 
somewhere into the tree. His goal is to be able to cut two edges and have the values of each of the three new 
trees sum to the same amount. This is called a balanced forest. Being frugal, the data value he inserts should 
be minimal. Determine the minimal amount that a new node can have to allow creation of a balanced forest. 
If it's not possible to create a balanced forest, return -1.
